Idea
----

- Ansi-to-html to convert console ansi code.
- Git-log for working history.
- Define data in json.
- Use Nodejs, but need to trigger the cli git to get correct color code, not from node.

Now, how to:
- Introduce myself


- Use git log for experience
- Whoami for introduce.
- Ls for skills.

- Minted require:
  - `-shell-escape`
  - `pymentize`
