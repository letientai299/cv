## Experience

### Shopee

<Tag
  title={'Expert Engineer'}
  location={'Singapore'}
  time={{ from: '09/2018', to: '08/2023' }}
/>

Played a key role in the Core Server, the monolithic backend powering Shopee
between 2014 and 2022. Transitioned to a sub-lead (4-8 members) within the
Item-Stock team formed during the migration to microservice architecture. Later,
led the SPKit Framework team (11 members), responsible for defining development
standards, creating tools and frameworks to accelerate development and uphold
code quality.

Took part in migrating billions of Item DB records from 10 to 1000 and then to
100000 DB servers without downtime.

Author or a lead maintainer of several critical services (outages would directly
impact Order fulfillment rate), with peak traffic exceeding 1 million QPS:

- `item-info`: serve all low level Item information queries.
- `item-id-generator`: solve Item creation DB hotspot.
- `order-id-generator`: prevent competitors from estimate Order rate and
  numerous related financial stats.
- `item-tag`: enable managing Item metadata flexibly.
- `item-audit`: keep logs of Item modifications

Original owner of many popular internal projects, some later became or inspired
the _standard development practices_ and the creation of SPKit Framework team:

- `gas` (Go Application Server): like Spring Boot for Golang, support dependency
  injection, abtracts away common server/objects life-cycle, allows devs to
  focus on business logic.
- `spkit`: tool for daily development tasks like `build`, `lint`, `test`, `gen`
  (code, components), ..., similar to
  [`rails` CLI](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html).
- `spbench`: adhoc benchmark tool for SPEX (Shopee RPC framework and protocol,
  like gRPC) service, inspired by [`wrk`](https://github.com/wg/wrk) and
  [`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)
- `central-ci`: centralized Gitlab CI config, supports common CI jobs like
  `build`, `lint`, `test`, `coverage`, `release` and custom jobs defined by
  users.
- `shared-service-template`: template and scaffolding tool used a lot during the
  migration from Core Server into microservices.
- `soupkit`: Golang API client for _SOUP_ (Shopee OAuth Platform, like
  [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview)).
- `core-logic`: common business logic and utilities extracted from Core Server.

Part-time cross-team contributor to some other high impact projects, notably:

- `goorm`: internal Go ORM, predate the popular OSS [`gorm`](https://gorm.io),
  now deprecated.
- `golang_splib`: Go implementation of SPEX, similar to
  [`grpc-go`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go)

Interviewer, mentor, consultant, frequent tech-sharing speaker, and a batman who
stay up all the nights of promotion days to monitor service health.

### Gee Pacific Technology Services Inc.

<Tag
  title={'Technical Lead'}
  location={'Philippines'}
  time={{ from: '03/2017', to: '06/2018' }}
/>

Joined as a Full Stack Engineer to maintain 12 online betting sites (10k-50k DAU
each) diverse from a single messy codebase. Quickly advanced to form and lead a
new team (20+ members, multidisciplinary) for building a completely new SaaS
system that covers all current features and allows spawning new sites faster.

Functioned like a CTO of a child company within the parent:

- Work with stakeholders to analyze business needs, manage roadmap and budget.
- Design the tech stack, architecture, DB schema, development workflow, hiring
  process, customer support flow, ...
- Set up productions, stagings, dev environments, private Docker registry,
  self-hosted Gitlab Runner, ...
- Hire and fire members.
- Lay the foundation codebase for all Spring Boot microservices. Mentor team
  members to be able to own their parts.

Learnt a ton from the job and all team members. Built a successful system (it's
still alive today), but left (instead of getting a share from it) due to feeling
guilty of building such thing.
