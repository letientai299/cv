## Experience

### Shopee

<Tag
  title={'Expert Software Engineer'}
  location={'Singapore'}
  time={{ from: '09/2018', to: '08/2023' }}
/>

One of key members of Core Server (the backend monolith powering Shopee since
2015, now deprecated); then become a sub-lead of Item-Stock team (formed during
migrating Core Server into microservices); then leads the SPKit Framework team,
which defines development standards, develop tooling and framework to support
and enforce such standards.

Author or maintainer of several critical, high performance microservices, some
handled more than 1M _QPS_ (queries per second), with billions of DB records.

- `order-id-generator`: if it downs, Order rate will drop to 0.
- `item-info`: if it downs, Order will drop to 0.
- `item-id-generator`: if it downs, no new Item can be added.
- `item-tag`: if it downs, some kind of Order can't be made.
- `item-audit`: if it downs, Item can't be edited.

Author and lead maintainer of many popular internal projects, some of which
became or inspired the _standard service development practices_ later:

- `shared-service-template`: template and scaffolding tool used a lot during the
  migration from Core Server into microservices.
- `core-logic`: common business logic and utilities extracted from Core Server.
- `spkit`: tool for daily development tasks like `build`, `lint`, `test`, `gen`
  (code, components), ..., similar to
  [`rails` CLI](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html).
- `spbench`: adhoc benchmark tool for SPEX (Shopee RPC framework and protocol,
  like gRPC) service, inspired by [`wrk`](https://github.com/wg/wrk) and
  [`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)
- `central-ci`: centralized Gitlab CI config, supports common CI jobs like
  `build`, `lint`, `test`, `coverage`, `release` and custom jobs defined by
  users.
- `soupkit`: Golang API client for _SOUP_ (Shopee OAuth Platform, similar to
  [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview)).

Part-time cross-team contributor to some other high impact projects, mostly
performance or bug fixes:

- `goorm`: internal Go ORM, exists before the popular OSS
  [`gorm`](https://gorm.io), now deprecated.
- `golang_splib`: Go implementation of SPEX, similar to
  [`grpc-go`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go)

In charge of many other projects, data migrations/analysis, tech designs, ...
related to those mentioned above.

Interviewer, mentors, frequent tech-sharing speaker, and a batman who stay up
all the nights of promotion days to monitor service health.

### Gee Pacific Technology Services Inc.

<Tag
  title={'Technical Lead'}
  location={'Philippines'}
  time={{ from: '03/2017', to: '06/2018' }}
/>

Joined as a Full Stack Engineer to maintain 12 online-betting sites, each has
10-50k, all was cloned and diverse from a single code based; then got assigned
to form a new team to develop a completely new system which should cover all
current sites' features and allow spawning new sites faster.

Function like a CTO of a child company within Gee Pacific:

- Work with stakeholders to analyze business requirements, manage budgets.
- Design the tech stack, system architecture, DB schema, development workflow,
  hiring flows, customer support flows, ...
- Lay the foundation for all subprojects. Then mentor, train team members to be
  able to own them.
- Set up productions, stagings, dev environments, private Docker registry,
  self-hosted Gitlab Runner, ...
- Hire and fire members.

Learned a ton, and build a successful project (it's still live), but leave
(instead of run and get profit from it) due to feeling guilty of building such
thing.
