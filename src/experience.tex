  {JUP2 Automation Testing | India}

    - The goal is to replace manual test with automation test, which should
    support wide range of productions that communicate to computer via several

    it to develop, execute scripts, generate reports in HTML, Excel or Markdown
    format.
    \\
    - Reimplement core libraries to support communication protocols, because
    the other 3 years old library can't  handle extended versions of
    our protocol, and there's no document or tests for that one.

    - Use ScalaCheck for unit testing core libraries.\\
    - Learn Xtext and Xtend for develop the DSL
